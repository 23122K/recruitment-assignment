## Dependencies
This project relies on three libraries/frameworks. The [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory) framework is utilized for dependency injection, [SwiftUINavigation](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swiftui-navigation) is used for routing, and a tiny library called [Shimmer](https://github.com/markiv/SwiftUI-Shimmer) is utilized for styling elements that require a placeholder during the loading process.

## Interface
The application supports both dark mode and light mode. Additionally, it includes a launch screen *(though it has some issues)* and an application icon.
